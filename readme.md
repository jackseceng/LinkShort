# LinkShort - Containerised URL shortener

This is the Python code and Docker configuration for a link shortening web app

- Running demonstration available at [cubel.ink](https://cubel.ink)

- [DockerHub image repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/jackseceng/linkshort)

I am using this to learn:
- Docker & Web App Hosting
- Python Development
- DevSecOps Automation

## Testing locally

- [Sign up for a free Turso account](https://app.turso.tech/signup), and create database with a table called 'urls' in with the follwing SQL statement:
```
CREATE TABLE
  urls (
    hashsum VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    url BLOB,
    salt BLOB,
    CONSTRAINT unique_hash UNIQUE (hashsum)
  );
```


- Create a file in the `/app` directory called `.env`, with the following contents, setting the appropriate values with your own substitutions:
```txt
ENDPOINT="<your-turso-url>"
TOKEN="<your-turso-token>"
TLD=localhost
```

**! WARNING !**

Please make sure your local environment variables in your terminal do not share names with the ones in this `.env` file.
> If you change the names of the variables in this file, make sure to change their references in the `docker-compose.yaml` file as well.

### Docker compose
From the root directory of this repository, run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
```bash
[+] Running (2/2)
 ✔ Network linkshort_ls-net   Created
 ✔ Container linkshort-app-1  Started
```

If succesful, app will be running at [http://localhost](http://localhost), it will connect to your Turso database over the internet.

You can re-run this command whenever you make changes to rebuild the container.

To shut down the service, run this command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Application Features
